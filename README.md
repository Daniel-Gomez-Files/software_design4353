Assignments 1- 4 for COSC 4353 software design course at University of Houston.

1. Discuss your initial thoughts in details on how you will design this application?

For our application, we decided to use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, mySQL, and Python on the frontend. We want to use HTML as a base and style it with CSS and Bootstrap so it can be dynamic instead of static. We will use JavaScript which the Bootstrap framework uses. We decided to use python in the backend along with mySQL and potentially calling API's for real time gas prices if needed.

2. Discuss what development methodology you will use and why?

We want to use the Agile method because we are doing our application incrementally based on the way the class assignments and due dates are set up. Using the Agile method will allow us to get it done efficiently since we have a small group of people in our team and our ideas/plans could change at any time during the building process. It will also let us test our product as we go, instead of other methods which don't have a working prototype until the end of the process.
